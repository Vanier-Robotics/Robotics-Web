## Underlying Technologies
This website will be built using `Gatsby`, a **React & JSX framework** designed for lightweight, resposive, scalable and easily deployable websites. Developing on this platform requires base knowledge of **HTML5 and CSS3**. JavaScript is optional but **heavily recommended**, as Gatsby uses some of its syntax in code formatting.

Documentation for Gatsby, which includes tutorials and code snippets is accessible by [clicking here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

We are also using Github (Git) for our code management and deployment, as it helps all of us keep track of who does what and when it was done. Please familiarize yourself with the interface,as you will be using it a lot during the development process. 

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
This guide assumes that you have a **valid installation of Windows** and that you are the **adminitrator** on your system. Before starting work on the website, there are some packages and applications that need to be installed to ensure that the development of the website is problem-free. This is step is critical to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that there are no conflicts in installed packages or missing dependencies. Below are instructions on the different packages to install for this project. Please ensure that you have sufficient hard drive space for this project (~5GB) to accomodate for any extra ressources and packages that may get added during the development process.

#### Installing Git
Installing git-scm is very straightforward and requires no extra configuration or setup to get working. Simply head on over to Git's website and [download and install the latest executable](https://git-scm.com/download/win). 

#### Installing VSCode
While most code editors will work well with this project, Visual Studio Code is recommended as it is has some plugins that we need to install to begin development on this project. 
1. Head over to Microsoft's Visual Studio Code website, and [download and install the latest executable](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win). 
2. Once complete, launch Visual Studio Code, and head over to the "Extensions" tab on the left side (it should look like 4 squares). Search for the "Prettier - Code Formatter" extension by Esben Petersen. Optionally, also install "Prettier - JavaScript Formatter" by Bastian Kistner.
--- You can also install the extensions by clicking [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) and [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=passionkind.prettier-vscode-with-tabs) if you are having trouble finding the "Extensions" tab. **Please make sure to restart Visual Studio Code once the installation is complete to make sure they are properly installed.**

#### Installing Node
Installing Node is, as with Git, a very straightforward process with minimal user configuration required. Head on over to their website and download [the LTS release (the left green button)](https://nodejs.org/en/). Make sure to **not select the extra features option during the installation**, as it will download an additional 3GB of files that will not be used during the development of this project.

#### Installing Gatsby with npm
Once you have installed NodeJS, you can now proceed with the installation of Gatsby, the framework that we will be using for this project. 
1. Begin by opening Command Prompt (WINDOWS BUTTON + R, then type cmd and hit Enter)
2. Check the version of **Node** by typing `node --version`. The version should be **above** `v12.10.0`. If it is not, please install a newer version of NodeJS.
3. Check the version of **npm** by typing `npm --version`. The version should be **above** `v6.10`. If it is not, please install a newer version of npm.
4. Once the checks are complete and that both *Node* and *npm* are installed, simply run `npm install -g gatsby-cli` to install the commandline interface of Gatsby. At the time that this documentation was written, **there are no standalone GUI interfaces available for download**. This installation guide will be updated if there are any new releases. 
5. Once the installation is complete, verify the version by typing `gatsby --version`. The current version of Gatsby CLI is **2.8.20**. Please make sure that your version is version 2.8 or above. If it is not, please reinstall Gatsby CLI by running the command above. Doing so will uninstall the previous version and install the latest one.
#### Installing GitHub Desktop - Optional
If you do not feel comfortable with using Git by itself, GitHub Desktop is a very good alternative, providing all of the features that Git does, using a GUI. Head over to the download page and [install GitHub for Desktop](https://central.github.com/deployments/desktop/desktop/latest/win32). From there, make sure that your Git name is the same as your username and your email is the same as your registered email on GitHub.
