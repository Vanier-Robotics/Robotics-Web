            <p>Starting off, the team had to finalize the plans and drawings for the robot before starting the construction of it. The team started the handy work by cutting the necessary metal for the frames of the robot. The arm of the robot was rebuilt several times and it went through different tests until the build team was satisfied with the results. Since the wait for the motors were a little bit long, the team managed to make the bottom frame of the robot and to test out how fast the robot will run with other spare motors in the robotics club room. The hallway was used to try and see how long the robot would take to go a certain distance in a given amount of time.</p>

            <p>The arm was broken at least once so the team is trying to remake a new one that is stronger and dynamic for the competition. The arm required a lot of sketching and planning before being able to make it. A couple of members decided to fully concentrate on the arm to make sure that it works properly. After receiving the motors, the team was able to assemble the robot. Thus, they pursued in making the arm with the extra metal available and other parts to finally be able to attach it to the robot. One member of build was able to set up the whole panel with the batteries and Vex cortex that will be used to drive and control the robot by the driver and in which the programming team needs for controlling the gadgets on the robot and the robot itself.</p>

                <p>It has all the necessary equipment on it. It can use all the powerups whether it is the arch, the mushrooms, the wrecking ball, the twister or the activation button for the conveyor belt on which the pouches slide on. The robot has 4 Mecanum wheels and one traction wheel in the middle of it. The ratio of the gears is 26:1 which reduces the amount of torque to attain the maximal speed for the robot. The robot is 28 inches by 28 inches.</p>

                <p>The rear of the robot has a metal bar that would push on the mushrooms during the competition and it is three feet long. The arm has a height of 37.5 inches, which is the ideal length. While it could reach a maximum of 39 inches and recoil back to a minimum of 36 inches. The arm could rotate about half of a circle (180 degrees) and this is for the goal of activating the power-up on the arc, which requires the robot to lift the ball all the way to the other side of the arch. The gear ratio for the arm is 256:1 which allows the arm to have the maximum amount of torque to use for the arch power up.  Another metal bar was placed in front of the robot to us to press on the activation button at the beginning and during the game. The robot also has plexiglass that will protect the Vex cortex and electrical wiring in the middle of the robot since it is defenseless. It has 6 Banebots motors in total. The robot maximum speed it could reach is 15 km/hr.</p>
