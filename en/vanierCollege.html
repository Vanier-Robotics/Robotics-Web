                    It has been fifty years since Vanier College was founded in Saint-Laurent in 1970, being the second English college in Québec( right after Dawson College). It was named after a man in the Canadian army (a Major General) and a former Governor General in Canada from 1959 to 1967, who was Georges-Philéas Vanier. The newest building, the N-building, was a part of the school in February of 1987 , in which much controversy and debate caused because this meant that its Snowdon campus would have been closed down. Faculty members and students decided to do a peaceful protest, but this did not prevent the construction of the building.

                    Most of the departments in the whole school offer a certain study room or lounge for their students to study in. There is TASC, which is a room where students could drop by or by appointment with questions or help needed with fellow peers or teachers on hand in many different subjects whether it is science, math, french , english etc. The school library has three floors on the third, fourth and fifth of the D-wing. The only way to enter is through the main entrance on the third floor.   The  students from all over the  Greater Montreal region come to study at this institution. The new Parc-Extension campus was opened on October 7, 2019 which was for the Continuing Education and Language School Departments. It is located on 550 Beaumont Ave., on the second floor. The sports complex (the G-building) provides the students with a fitness room for those who want to, a pool to go swimming during certain hours and many sports teams for the students to be a part of . During the semester, there are many events that are hosted by the VSCA to encourage the students to be  a part of the Vanier student life. Various departments host different events during the whole year like Social Science Week. Students are allowed to run their own clubs at Vanier and most of them are located on the first floor of the D-wing such as the anime club, music club,and a newspaper club.
