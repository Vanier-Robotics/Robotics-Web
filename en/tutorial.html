            Welcome to the page where Elmo is going to teach you how to make friends! You know that feeling of not having anyone to play with, to talk with, or to laugh with? It makes you feel sad and your heart hurts, right? This is what loneliness is. It is a problem that everybody lives through. You are not the only one. That is why Elmo, your best friend, is here to help you make friends in the CRC Robotics Competition. Vanier Street is a perfect neighborhood to be in. We all work together to make a robot, so friendship is very important to us. Elmo even made a song called “Anyone Can Be Friends”.

            So how do we make friends? It is really easy! The Vanier Robotics team is a kind and friendly club. So you will find a friend in no time! Talking to people and listening to people are important steps, but that does not mean you are friends yet! Making friends is not that easy! The Vanier Robotics club room and the STEM Center is going to help you. Many friends use both rooms to work on the kiosk, build a robot, keep track of the progress of all the teams in robotics, program the website, program the robot and make the video. When you sign up for the club, you can pick which team you want to be a part of. Do not worry! You can be a part of as many teams you want to. When you go to work with your fellow teammates on the project, try to say hello to everyone and learn their names. In this environment, everyone likes to say hello to each other. A good friend is one that always smile while saying hello and that can remember a person’s name. Being positive is important, because the nicer you are, the warmer you are, so people will want to stick close to you! Be nice to everyone and everyone will be nice to you. You should always help people who are in need. They will do the same to you in the future. Do not say mean things, even if you do not like them or they did something bad. That is not nice to that person. Even mean people can be friends later on. If your friends say mean things about other people, stop them, and tell them that is not nice and very unfriendly. Never hurt people, friend or not.

            If you make enough friends, you will surely win any robotics competition! It can even make you smarter! Coming with ideas for the competition cannot be done alone. That is why meetings are important! You can share your ideas with your friends and tell could give feedback or an even better idea! More friends means better creativity and diversity, so you will always have fresh ideas. Friends can teach each other a lot of things, like how to wire, how to program a website or a robot, how to set up a kiosk, and many more. Being smart at one thing is not good enough, so try to learn as much as you can! If you are good at something, teach your friends how to do it! Do not be shy to ask them to teach you something as well. However, this does not mean you have to be nice only to your friends at the robotics club. Be nice to everyone, because the whole world can be your friend! During the competition, you can even make friends with people from other robotics clubs from other schools. Be nice and help each other. There is no rule that says you cannot be friends with other teams. You can even make alliances through friendship. This can help you and your team if you need help during the competition!

            Did you make a friend yet? If yes, that is great! If not, do not worry! It is not easy for everyone, because it depends on each person. A person’s shyness and sociability can make it harder for them or easier. As long as you keep working hard. You will no doubt find a friend!
