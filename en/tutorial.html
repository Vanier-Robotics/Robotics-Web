            Welcome to the page where Elmo is going to teach you how to make friends! You know that feeling of not having anyone to play with, to talk with, or to laugh with? It makes you feel sad and your heart hurts, right? This is what loneliness is. It is a problem that everybody lives through. You are not the only one. That is why Elmo, your good friend, is here to help you make friends in the CRC Robotics Competition. Vanier Street is a perfect neighborhood to be in. We all work together to make a robot, so friendship is very important to us. Elmo even made a song called “Anyone Can Be Friends”.

            So how do we make friends? It is really easy! The Vanier Robotics team is a kind and friendly club. So you will find a friend in no time! Talking to people and listening to people are important steps, but that does not mean you are friends yet! Making friends is not that easy! The Vanier Robotics club room and the STEM Center is going to help you. Many friends use both rooms to work on the kiosk, build a robot, keep track of the progress of all the teams in robotics, program the website, program the robot and make the video. When you sign up for the club, you can pick which team you want to be a part of. Do not worry! You can be a part of as many teams you want to. When you go to work with your fellow teammates on the project, try to say hello to everyone and learn their names. In this environment, everyone likes to say hello to each other. A good friend is one that always smile while saying hello and that can remember a person’s name. Being positive is important, because the nicer you are, the warmer you are, so people will want to stick close to you! Be nice to everyone and everyone will be nice to you. You should always help people who are in need. They will do the same to you in the future. Do not say mean things, even if you do not like them or they did something bad. That is not nice to that person. Even mean people can be friends later on. If your friends say mean things about other people, stop them, and tell them that is not nice and very unfriendly. Never hurt people, friends or not.

            Making friends in the robotics competition or anywhere else can help you in many ways. The competition allows you to help out either the members of your team or other teams that are in need of a helping hand. Sportsmanship is very important in competitions like these. Awards are presented for this category. You can learn many skills from friends, like how to wire, how to program a website or a robot, how to set up a kiosk, and many more. You can even meet people who are experts in their field. They can increase your team’s chances of winning. An important rule of robotics is safety. Working alone can increase the chances of harming yourself. The friends around you can make sure you work in a safe environment. This prevents you from harming yourself and them. Having more people work on a project can increase the quality of the final product. In meetings, people will come up with many ideas, all different from each other. This boosts creativity and diversity. Fighting between friends is not good, but it can happen. It is normal, and can deepen a friendship.
