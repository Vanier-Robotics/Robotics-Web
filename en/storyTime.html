        <section>
          <h1>Build</h1>
          <section>
            <h1>Hardships for construction of the robot</h1>
          </section>
          <p>At the beginning of the building process of the robot, the team had a lot of confusion and uncertainty about how big or small should the robot be for the competition. This was all based on what strategy would the team take into the games. Another issue was what set of wheels to use for the robot. Would they all be the same kind, or the two in the front of the robot would be different from the ones in the back of it? After the team received their order of new motors for the robot, they were not the correct ones and thus we had to be sent back to the manufacturer. That caused some delays and troubles for the team as they were not able to assemble the robot without these important parts. Since they did not plan out exactly what material they needed from the beginning or realized that they were missing parts during the last two weeks, some of the members of the team went to the local hardware stores to buy what was missing. As well, the screws that were ordered online were a little too big, so they had to be cut a little bit to the required dimensions that were needed for the robot. There was a debate on how big the robot should be, whether 2,5 feet by 2.5 feet or 3 feet by 3 feet. Another issue is also the length of the metal bar in the back with the fear of not being able to make it passed under the arch at all. Some members did not have much experience as others did, since this was their first CRC robotics competition.</p>
          <section>
            <h1>Solutions to the problems that arose during the time frame</h1>
          </section>
          <p>A big thanks should be given to Wesley, one of the mentors, who was able to cut the plexiglas that the build team needed for the robot. Purchasing Plexiglas and asking a professional to cut it would cost us a fair amount. However, Wesley did it for us free of charge. The team also traded some remaining parts with the robotics team of Marianopolis for two of our missing motors. Many of the members of the robotics team went shopping for different materials which the build team needed. Ultimately, since the team did not know exactly what sort of strategy to have going into Flip 2020, they decided to equip everything that would be needed to use any of the powerups during the five-minute game. In that case, the team can choose a different strategy to use in every game they play depending on who are their opponents and teammates they will have. The team changed the metal sheet with another metal bar (arm) to activate the actuator button of the conveyor belt. The panel would have not been able to sustain so much damage from pressing hard on the button so many times during the games of Flip 2020.</p>

          <h1>Kiosk</h1>
          <section>
            <h1>Why Sesame Street?</h1>
          </section>
          <p>Sesame Street is a children’s television show that started airing in 1969. The show takes place in a New York suburb and the concept is a bunch of puppets that teach young minds numbers, letters and life skills. Although it is a children’s show, Sesame Street also teaches important values and principles that follow us throughout our entire lives. With 50 seasons, the show has taught children subjects like respect, integrity and diversity. Similarly, these values are also advocated at Vanier College through our policies, programs and student body. The idea came about because this year marks the fiftieth years of Vanier College, whereas there have been a few campaigns in the past year celebrating 50 years of Sesame Street. Working with a show that has such a big influence on kids has allowed us to find our inner child, something that we often forget about with the pressures of the everyday world. By choosing this theme, the main message that we hope to get across is the importance of mixing education with fun which we feel encompasses one of the many objectives of CRC.</p>
          <section>
            <h1>Walls, door frame and stairs</h1>
          </section>
          <p>The kiosk is designed in a way where people are first greeted by the famous steps and green door that are in every episode. When walking into the kiosk, reality is left behind as one enters “Elmo’s World” which is also where the robot will be worked on. A purple table was designed so that the robot can be placed there to be worked on. The top is removable for easy access to the bottom of the robot. There are a total of 9 walls in the kiosk that are all 4 by 8 feet. They were primed and painted a shade of off-white. Then, to recreate the room in the Elmo’s World segment, bright swirls of yellow, blue and green were painted at the top of all of the walls. To stay true to the urban New York setting, a brick background was cut out and added to several walls. To add some dimension to the fake green door, a door frame surrounds it. In order to make the stairs more authentic in terms of texture, a layer of concrete was put on the stairs. Normally, this would not have been done because of how heavy concrete will make the stairs, but since the competition is held at Vanier, it was especially advantageous. A railing made of wood is also added to the stairs for safety precautions. However, the stairs are not to be used and so there will be a “Under Construction” sign to capture the essence of painful, dragged-out city construction.</p>
          <section>
            <h1>Pole and Vanier Street Sign</h1>
          </section>
          <p>When passing by the kiosk, there will be a bright green pole standing 8 feet high with a sign on top similar to that on Sesame Street. Instead of it saying “123 Sesame Street”, it will say “018 Vanier Street”. There were a few complications with the pole as its original design was made out of Styrofoam. As what happens with a lot of ideas, they seem good on paper, but sometimes it doesn’t come out quite as we imagined. Instead, the pole will be made from one of the 3D printers that the school has and then painted green. Then, a type of white, opaque fish bowl is being placed on top of the pole with lights inside. There will also be a Subway sign on top of the entire kiosk to indicate the entrance to the kiosk as well as the small but fun games taking place.</p>
          <section>
            <h1>Added Details</h1>
          </section>
          <p>Sesame Street would be nothing without the puppets, which is why it was an absolute necessity to include them in our kiosk. Firstly, there is a metal trash can, but not used for garbage! When opening the lid, Oscar the Grouch will appear. On the stairs, you’ll find Elmo, Big Bird plushies, and another Sesame Street friend will be wandering around so be on the lookout! Elmo might be one of the most popular characters on the show, but no one can forget his beloved pet fish, Dorothy. It’s for this reason that we chose to include a goldfish on the table of our kiosk. She is our moral support while presentations are being done and ultimately there to cheer Vanier on in the competition. Finally, to display teamwork and allow everyone to take part in the Vanier kiosk, the public will be able to draw their own pictures and put it on the walls.</p>

          <h1>Video</h1>
        </section>
        <p>Though we had a very small team of members to work on the video, it still proved to be efficient as there were little to no squabbles between members. When it came to brainstorm the idea for the video, since the theme is Sesame Street, we decided to make the video somewhat like a mock-up of a typical educational episode that one would watch on Sesame Street.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The plot of this “episode” is that a human character would visit the Vanier Robotics team and see that the puppets were working very hard on a robot to enter the CRC Robotics competition. This was an effective way to describe the details of the organization and this year’s game, introduce the school that our team is representing, as well as talk about our robot that we are building. So, that’s how Vanier Street was created! Speaking of puppets... we thought we could make our Vanier Street video extra special with our own original Sesame Street-inspired puppets! At first, there were going to be a character made for each captain on the Robotics team. We later decided to keep it to a minimal number because making puppets is a very complex and delicate process. We kept four puppet ideas and have one human character to be the one to inquire information about the Robotics competition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Julie volunteered to build these puppets. It was a stressful period of time. The clock was ticking since the characters were the foundation for the entirety of the video. Julie had to settle with felt as a replacement for fleece, which was the original material used to make the actual puppets, because she was unable to find fleece in stores. Cardboard was used for the skeleton. Other materials and tools used includes scissors, duct tape, hot glue, carton paper, Styrofoam balls, pens, and a pair of earrings. Chef was based on Cookie Monster and he had the ability of having arms that could be easily controlled. Craig Wyllyan was based on the Count and the impracticality that came with him is that only Julie’s arm could fit through his body since she had used measurements of her own arm to make it. For the creation of Belmo and Gibbo, Julie had to get out her thinking cap. There was a lack of yellow felt as well as red felt. Bootleg Elmo, cough, I mean Belmo, had to have a t-shirt to cover up his different-colored body. In the end, it all turned out well and everyone appreciated each puppet’s quirky traits (with Gibbo being the most special fella!). She was able to learn that proper planning is the most important aspect of a project, and she was able to keep this in mind when it came for directing the rest of the video, which includes filming and sound recording.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Sesame Street is nothing without its little musical moments. We obviously had to include the classic theme song at the beginning. It would serve as our description of Vanier College, as it would show the characters interacting with the Vanier environment. We also wanted to write our own lyrics to show our Vanier spirit. We are eternally grateful to have Gloria on our team as she was the mastermind behind the two songs that were written specifically for this video. While brainstorming for lyric ideas for the Vanier Street theme song, she kept in mind what made Vanier College so special, whether it is the student-run Jake’s Café, the popular area of Cote-Vertu, or the overpopulation of squirrels on the front yard. Nevertheless, all of these are included! It is truly a song that represents life at Vanier. It should be the anthem of all Vanier students; of all CÉGEP students. Concerning the second masterfully written song, it is based on the Count’s classic song. The twist? The lyrics have been changed to have it be a song about Flip 2020, and it is in both French and English! The song describes the rules of the game and the different actuators that will be on the playing field. Finally, she did the instrumentals for the songs. Speaking of this specific portion of the video, the one to do the mind-blowing animation of the arena is David, another member of our delightful team, with a bit of help from our mentor, Richard! The idea was that the characters would show a colorful book where they had drawn illustrations of the Flip 2020 game. Then, as we, the viewers, dive into this drawing world, the different elements of the Flip 2020 game would pop-up! The elements purposely had a Crayola crayon texture, as though they were actually drawn by kids. David had no problem making the idea come to life and his contribution massively helps illustrate the game of this year’s CRC competition.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As for the scriptwriting, Massimo and Julie dove deep into the wildest parts of their imagination to come up with the dialogue between the wacky characters. Whereas the character of Craig Wyllyan served more for the explanation part of the video, the others had more flare to them: Chef would say a bunch of cooking puns, Gibbo would utter gibberish but still be stating quite intellectual things, and Belmo was just Belmo. The idea for the “robot” box came in later in the creation of the script, where we had thought it would be funny that the puppets were working so hard on their creation, and that finally it came out looking like a poor last minute arts-and-crafts project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Probably one of the most memorable moments of this entire process is the recording of the songs. It truly felt like a choir group, except we all had deadpan tones, which unintentionally added to the “student life” feel to the song.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Organization was no issue for both the production of the video and for time management. We were able to effectively split the workload between members without any issues. We all had a fair share of load to manage. We had established a good schedule for the filming for the different scenes that would be done on separate days, and we left ourselves a lot of time to edit.</p>
        <br>
        <p>An issue that we encountered was that there was no clear idea for a background set for the dialogue scene between the characters. Fortunately, we had good problem-solving skills and were able to come up with a set on the spot. We used two interior walls, that were not originally planned to be used from the kiosk team and propped them up next to the bookshelves in the STEM center. We also added a few hand-drawn illustrations to the walls as decorations and embellished the set with the Vanier Street sign that was made by the kiosk team. What we learned is to make the most out of the resources around you; help out the other teams around you and you could potentially gain something worthwhile, like a background set!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, the time came for the most dreaded part of video production: editing. The software that was used was Adobe Premiere Pro. It was actually fun to look through all the raw footage that was shot and to pick the clips that would be used for. The usual editing problems occurred; program crashing, computers freezing, late night frenzies to finish a part for a specific date set and exporting issues. Nevertheless, it is persistence that is key for this long process. In the end, the lesson that we learned was that by utilizing the different sets of skills that we bring to the table, we were able to produce this short video effortlessly. The creation of a final product is like a breeze when you have effective communication between members of a team, as well as when you’re having fun doing it.</p>

          <h1>Web</h1>
        </section>
        <p>This year, the creation of the Web team was weird. Richard became captain despite lacking experience for leadership and website programming. Luckily, a freshman named Ron saved the team. With his expertise, he helped the team organise and set up the development of the website. He and another member, Mykyta, did all the hard work of making the website work by doing most of the back-end. Other members, like Romaissa, David, Slava, and Richard contributed to the front-end of the website.</p>
        <br>
        <p>With a small amount of returning members of robotics, most members were new students. Aside from a handful of people, most of the web team were still learning HTML. Robotics is a learning experience, so we encouraged them to learn all about website coding, and come to school to learn and ask questions about it. Also, Jethro, older Massimo, and older Richard were there to help them as mentors.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While not being experienced with website development, Richard was able to balance his other position of journalism captain. He would mainly focus on the management of the team. Meanwhile, Ron will manage the code itself.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Richard was tasked to come up with a design to match with the theme of Sesame Street. Ron helped with it as well. The base design was to have a landing page with toy blocks to imitate an opening scene from Sesame Street. Once inside, you can see the green pole from the show on the left side of the screen. The pole serves as a navigation bar with all the plates named after the pages of the website. Each page will be inside the box on the right of the pole. Most page will only contain text and images, aside from tutorial which has text and videos. The page that displays all members of Vanier robotics team, called Characters, simulates the display of the Sesame Street characters. The other unique page would be the Art page to display all the pictures taken for robotics. It is called Art to simulate the art pages on website aimed for children which displays the pictures taken from the show. Since most of us are inexperience with the competition, we decided to mainly focus outputting the minimum required for the competition and to include all topics that were on last year’s Vanier website. If we have time, we will add more functions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The most troublesome pages were the page that includes the list of our members and the gallery page. Both page contained many moving parts. Many trials and errors leads to us finally being able to fix the issues. Programming is not difficult. It is simply a time demanding process. Problems can appear out of thin air out for no reason. Finding the origin of the issue requires time. However, most issues can be solved be a simple search on the Internet as programming became more and more accessible to learn through the online community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Probably one of the most memorable moments of this entire process is the recording of the songs. It truly felt like a choir group, except we all had deadpan tones, which unintentionally added to the “student life” feel to the song.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite our best efforts to learn web programming as soon as possible, it was not up to standard. Most of the codes were written in HTML and had a minimum of CSS. However, Ron wanted us to write in JSX, but it was too advanced for the members. This lead to Ron and Mykyta fixing most of the coding. They rewrote our HTML and CSS code into JSX and implemented them unto GitHub. However, seeing the website being nearly complete is a sight to be beholden. Small or big, everyone's contributions lead to this website.</p>

          <h1>Journalism</h1>
          <section>
            <h1>Experiences of the journalism members</h1>
          </section>
          <p>During the first couple of months of college, the journalism members had to take down notes of what all the teams were doing in Vanier Robotics. The journalists had to keep track of the different issues going on, any big news or obstacles the teams were going to face during the course of the weeks leading up to the competition of Flip 2020.  Journalism in itself was quite a great experience for the three members since they were playing important roles in many of the teams already and also had to take the duties of writing and translating the different pages that were necessary for the Vanier Robotics website. Paying attention and listening were some of the main skills that the team members developed over their time as the hard-working writers for the Vanier Robotics club. For their hard work and dedication to the Vanier Robotics team, Nicholas and Erika were chosen as two of the presenters of the kiosk during the three days of the competition. Erika, a kiosk and journalism member, took care of writing the Flip 2020 page of the website, a page about how the kiosk is and other pages. Nicholas, a member of build and journalism, wrote about the page for Vanier college, the page about the robot, the tutorial on how to make friends, the journalism experience page, filmed and took pictures during the two weeks of intense work for the club. Richard, the captain of the web team and journalism, contributed in writing the tutorial, the experiences pages of many of the other teams, the bios of the team members and other pages on the website.</p>
          <section>
            <h1>Hardships that the journalism team faced</h1>
          </section>
          <p>One of the major issues that this team faced was the translation of the different pages of the website in French. The team had to ask for the help amongst each other and from other members of the Vanier Robotics team to help. Another factor was the limited time the journalist had to write the pages since they were as well occupied with other duties with the other teams. Even though they had their teams that they originally were a part of from the beginning, they were trying to constantly give an extra hand of help to the variety of teams which make up the Vanier Robotics club. They had to ask sometimes the team captains for some of the specific details and information they needed to include in the pages that they wrote for the teams. As well, being only three members in the journalism team was a lot of work to them since they had not other members to help them write the necessary pages for the website. They had to work hard and put a lot of effort into journalism.</p>
