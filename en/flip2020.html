                        CRC Robotics is a competition held annually in the month of February. Founded in 2001, the competition aims to challenge today’s youth by having high schools and CEGEPS compete on the provincial level. By integrating different fields of study that make up both the arts and the sciences (STEM), CRC encourages students with a wide range of interests to join. CRC has become more than just a competition and is now a non-profit organization that helps young minds explore the world of science and everything it has to offer.

                        The 19th CRC Robotics competition, named Flip 2020, will be held at Vanier College on the 13th, the 14th, and the 15th of February, this 2020. Similar to previous competitions, there are two teams, a yellow team and a blue team, composed of four schools. During each five-minute match, known as a “heat”, one team will have two robots and must compete against the two other robots on the other team. The Flip 2020 tournament is divided into five stages. The preliminary round is held on Thursday night and Friday. These games will determine whether a team advances to quarterfinals, semi-finals or play in the knock-out round. The knock-out round will take place on Saturday morning and the top teams will advance to the quarterfinals. The teams with the highest ranking in the quarterfinals as well as the preliminary round will move on to the semi-finals. The finals will include the top teams from the semi-finals. This year, the playing field can be divided up into the starting zones at one end, a conveyor belt located at the other end and various actuators that trigger a power-up. In order to navigate through the playing field, there is a pilot who is in control of the robot as well as a co-pilot as an extra set of eyes. The pilot and co-pilot are to be seated in their assigned area and must remain seated. They are also in charge of informing the referee which of the three power-up options that they would like to have during the heat.

                        The main goal of Flip 2020 is to accumulate as many points as possible. This can be done in numerous ways and is dependent on the strategy of each team. This year, the game pieces used are red and black bean bags. Points are calculated by how many bean bags are dropped into the team’s bin as well as the color. The red bean bags are worth 20 points while the black bean bags are 200 points. While they have more value, the black bean bags can only be accessed by activating a power-up. The power-ups that can be used are defined by the actuators that are linked to them. They consist of the chained ball, the arch, the mushrooms, the hinged board and the twister. Each team have their own actuators excluding the twister, which is common to both teams. Both schools that make up one team must activate at least one power-up. If one of the two robots on one team fails to do so, they will not receive the total score at the end of the heat. While the bean bags are the main contributors to a high final score, timing is equally as important during the heat. The chained ball, the arch, the twister and the mushroom all include the ability to change the rate of the bean bag dispenser or the speed of the conveyor. The hinged board differs because it has the ability to flip the direction. However, there are three power-up choices for the arch which the pilots and co-pilots must report to the referee before-hand.

                        Throughout the competition, there are various categories that each team is being critiqued on. To name a few, these include robot design, kiosk, programming, video, website design and content. The awards presented are not limited to these categories and there is an overall ranking award given to the three teams with the highest overall score. There are a few rules that one must abide by to ensure that no points be removed. Some of these rules include hitting another robot and triggering another team’s actuator. Even personally assisting the robot on the playing field will result in a penalty of 20%.
